            <h1>Chapter 4 : A Dark Encounter</h1>
            <p>The next day, Elvira took Yuji on a tour of the village. They visited the shops, the tavern, and the other places of interest, and Yuji was amazed by the sights and sounds of this new world.</p>
            <p>As they walked, they came across a group of villagers gathered around a notice board. Curious, they went over to see what was going on.</p>
            <p>On the board, there was a notice about a dark creature that had been spotted in the nearby woods. The villagers were frightened, and many were offering a reward to anyone who could get rid of the creature.</p>
            <p>Elvira frowned as she read the notice. "This is not good," she said. "The creature they're talking about is a wraith. They're dangerous, and very difficult to defeat."</p>
            <p>Yuji felt a shiver run down his spine. He had heard of wraiths before, and knew they were not to be taken lightly.</p>
            <p>But Elvira was determined to help. "We have to do something," she said. "We can't let this creature harm the villagers."</p>
            <p>Together, they set out into the woods, following the trail of the wraith. Yuji could feel the magic tingling in the air, and he knew they were getting close.</p>
            <p>Finally, they came to a clearing, where they saw the wraith hovering in the air. It was a dark, shadowy creature, with glowing red eyes and a sense of malice that sent chills down Yuji's spine.</p>
            <p>Elvira raised her staff and began to chant a spell. The air around them began to shimmer and twist, and Yuji felt a surge of magic building within him.</p>
            <p>But before they could do anything, the wraith turned its attention on them. With a bloodcurdling shriek, it flew towards them, its tendrils of darkness reaching out to ensnare them.</p>
            <p>Yuji felt a wave of terror wash over him. He raised his hands and tried to cast a spell, but the wraith was too powerful. It grabbed him and lifted him off the ground, its grip tightening around his neck.</p>
            <p>Elvira was quick to act. With a flick of her wrist, she sent a bolt of lightning towards the wraith. The creature shrieked in pain, and Yuji felt its grip loosen.</p>
            <p>Taking advantage of the moment, he cast a spell of his own. He felt the magic surge through him, and a blast of energy shot towards the wraith.</p>
            <p>The creature let out a final scream, then dissipated into a cloud of dark smoke.</p>
            <p>Yuji fell to the ground, gasping for air. Elvira rushed to his side, her face full of concern.</p>
            <p>"Are you all right?" she asked.</p>
            <p>Yuji nodded, still catching his breath. He couldn't believe what had just happened. They had defeated a wraith, a creature that was supposed to be unbeatable.</p>
            <p>As they made their way back to the village, Yuji felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had faced his first real challenge in this new world, and he had come out victorious.</p>
            <p>He knew that there would be more challenges to come, but with Elvira by his side and his growing mastery of magic, he was ready to face them head on.</p>

            <h1>Chapter 1 : The Summoning</h1>
            <p>Yuji had never believed in magic. He had always thought that the world was a mundane and predictable place, governed by the laws of science and reason. But all of that changed when he was suddenly whisked away to another world by a powerful mage.</p>
            <p>The summoning had been a shock to Yuji's system. He had felt a sensation like nothing he had ever experienced before – as if his very soul was being torn from his body. When the sensation faded and he opened his eyes, he found himself standing in the middle of a strange, otherworldly chamber.</p>
            <p>At first, Yuji was too disoriented to take in his surroundings. But as his senses gradually returned to him, he began to notice the details of the chamber: the intricate magical symbols etched into the walls, the flickering torches that provided the only source of light, and the imposing figure of the mage who stood before him.</p>
            <p>The mage was an imposing figure, tall and broad-shouldered, with a thick beard and piercing eyes. He regarded Yuji with a mixture of curiosity and disdain.</p>
            <p>"So," he said, in a voice that rumbled like thunder. "You are the one I have summoned."</p>
            <p>Yuji didn't know what to say. He had so many questions – how had he been summoned? Where was he? And most importantly, how was he going to get back home?</p>
            <p>But before he could voice any of these concerns, something strange began to happen to him. He felt a sudden, intense pain in his chest, as if he was being ripped apart from the inside. He clutched at his chest, gasping for air, as his body began to change.</p>
            <p>His hair grew longer and more lustrous, his features softened and became more delicate, and his clothes transformed into a flowing gown. Yuji felt his body growing lighter and more ethereal, until he looked down and saw that he had become…a girl.</p>
            <p>Yuji was stunned. How had this happened? Was this some kind of bizarre side effect of the summoning?</p>
            <p>The mage regarded Yuji with a hint of amusement. "It seems I have made a slight miscalculation in my spell," he said, almost apologetically. "But no matter. You will still serve my purposes just fine."</p>
            <p>Yuji didn't like the sound of that. He had a sinking feeling that he was in for a lot of trouble. But before he could say anything, the mage began to chant an incantation, and a bright light enveloped Yuji's body.</p>
            <p>The next thing Yuji knew, he was falling through space and time, hurtling towards a new world that he had never seen before. As he fell, he felt a strange, tingly sensation in his fingertips, as if he was being infused with a powerful new energy.</p>
            <p>When he landed, Yuji looked around him, dazed and confused. He saw that he was in a lush, green forest, filled with trees and plants that he had never seen before. The air was thick with the scent of wildflowers and pine needles, and the sky was a deep shade of blue.</p>
            <p>But as Yuji looked around, he realized that he wasn't alone. A group of strange, humanoid creatures had gathered around him, chattering and pointing at him with curious expressions on their faces.</p>
            <p>Yuji had no idea what was going on, or what was going to happen to him. But one thing was for sure – his life was never going to be the same again.</p>

            <h1>Chapter 4 : A Chance Encounter</h1>
              <p>Ryuu had been living in the village for several weeks now, and she had become an integral part of the community. The villagers had come to rely on her for her magical abilities, and she had formed close relationships with many of them.</p>
              <p>One day, while Ryuu was out for a walk, she heard the sound of someone crying. She followed the sound to the edge of the village, where she found a young woman sitting on a bench, tears streaming down her face.</p>
              <p>Ryuu approached the woman cautiously, not wanting to startle her. "Excuse me," she said softly, "are you okay?"</p>
              <p>The woman looked up at Ryuu, surprised to see a girl with dragon horns. But she quickly composed herself and said, "I'm fine. I'm just a little upset."</p>
              <p>Ryuu sat down on the bench next to the woman. "Would you like to talk about it?" she asked.</p>
              <p>The woman hesitated for a moment, but then she began to pour out her heart to Ryuu. She explained that her husband had died a few months ago, leaving her to care for their young daughter alone. She was struggling to make ends meet, and she felt overwhelmed by the weight of her responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Ryuu listened with empathy and understanding. She had never experienced the loss of a loved one, but she could imagine how difficult it must be for the young woman.</p>
              <p>After the woman had finished talking, Ryuu sat in silence for a moment, thinking. Then she said, "I have an idea. Would you like me to use my magic to help you?"</p>
              <p>The woman looked at Ryuu, surprised. "How could you possibly help me?" she asked.</p>
              <p>Ryuu smiled. "I have powers that can make your life a little easier. I can help your crops grow faster, or I can help you with household chores. Whatever you need, just tell me."</p>
              <p>The woman looked at Ryuu with gratitude in her eyes. "Thank you," she said. "That would be wonderful."</p>
              <p>Ryuu spent the next few days helping the woman with her chores. She used her magic to make the crops grow faster and stronger, and she helped the woman with the cooking and cleaning. The woman was amazed by Ryuu's abilities, and she felt a sense of hope for the first time since her husband's death.</p>
              <p>As Ryuu was leaving the woman's house one day, she heard a voice behind her. "Excuse me," the voice said, "are you the girl with dragon horns who's been helping everyone in the village?"</p>
              <p>Ryuu turned around and saw a young man standing there. He was tall and handsome, with bright blue eyes and a friendly smile.</p>
              <p>"Yes, that's me," Ryuu said, smiling.</p>
              <p>The young man stepped closer to Ryuu. "My name is Tatsuo," he said. "I just wanted to thank you for all the help you've been giving to the people in the village. You're a real hero."</p>
              <p>Ryuu blushed at Tatsuo's words. She had never been called a hero before, but she was pleased that her efforts were being recognized.</p>
              <p>They talked for a few minutes, and Ryuu found herself enjoying Tatsuo's company. He was kind and intelligent, and he seemed genuinely interested in getting to know her.</p>
              <p>As Ryuu walked home that day, she couldn't help but think about Tatsuo. She had never been attracted to a human before, but something about him stirred her heart. She wondered if she would see him again.</p>
              <p>Little did she know that her encounter with Tatsuo would change the course of her life forever.</p>

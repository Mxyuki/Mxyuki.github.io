            <h1>Chapter 5 : A Dragon's Appetite</h1>
              <p>Ryuu couldn't stop thinking about Tatsuo after their chance encounter. She found herself daydreaming about him, wondering if they would meet again.</p>
              <p>One day, while she was out gathering ingredients for a potion, Ryuu heard a commotion in the village square. She hurried over to see what was happening, and she found a group of people gathered around a food stall.</p>
              <p>The stall was run by a man named Hiro, who was known throughout the village for his delicious food. He was famous for his dumplings, which were said to be the best in the land.</p>
              <p>Ryuu had never tasted human food before, but the scent of Hiro's cooking was too enticing to resist. She approached the stall and asked for a dumpling.</p>
              <p>Hiro looked at Ryuu skeptically. "Are you sure you want one of these?" he asked. "They're made for human tastes, not dragons."</p>
              <p>Ryuu was undeterred. She had always been curious about human food, and she was eager to try something new. She took a bite of the dumpling, and her taste buds exploded with flavor.</p>
              <p>It was like nothing she had ever tasted before. The combination of savory meat, fragrant herbs, and delicate dough was like a symphony in her mouth. She devoured the dumpling in a matter of seconds, and then she asked for another.</p>
              <p>Hiro looked at Ryuu in amazement. He had never seen a dragon enjoy human food before. He began to prepare more dumplings for her, eager to see her reaction.</p>
              <p>As Ryuu ate, she felt a sense of joy that she had never experienced before. She had always loved hunting and devouring animals, but there was something different about human food. It was more than just sustenance â€“ it was an experience.</p>
              <p>She ate until she was completely full, and then she thanked Hiro and headed back to her house. But as she walked, she began to feel a strange sensation in her stomach.</p>
              <p>It was like a hunger, but it was different from anything she had felt before. It was a craving for something she couldn't name, something that she had never tasted before.</p>
              <p>She tried to ignore the feeling, but it grew stronger with each passing moment. She couldn't focus on her work, and she found herself daydreaming about Hiro's dumplings.</p>
              <p>Finally, she gave in to the temptation. She went back to Hiro's stall and asked for more dumplings. This time, she bought an entire basket.</p>
              <p>As she walked back to her house, she devoured the dumplings one by one. She knew that she was eating too much, but she couldn't stop herself. The taste was too delicious to resist.</p>
              <p>When she finally reached her house, she collapsed on the floor, feeling sick and bloated. She had never felt so full in her life. But even as she lay there, groaning with discomfort, she couldn't stop thinking about the dumplings.</p>
              <p>She realized that she had developed an appetite for human food, and it was a craving that wouldn't be satisfied easily. She wondered if she would be able to control her hunger, or if it would consume her entirely.</p>
